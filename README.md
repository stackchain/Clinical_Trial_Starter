One of the main problems in starting a Clinical Trial for is Funding.
I created this Decentralized application to help anyone who is interested in making a Clinical Trial possible using the Ethereum Blockchain and as part of my project in ConsenSys class. Researchers can now meet with potential donors and can donate using Blockchain.

To be able to get ether you can go to https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ 
and follow the instructions. To request for funds, tweet with your Ethereum address pasted into the contents
via twitter, facebook and google plus public forum

9. You can now start creating a proposal for your the clinical trial 

Additional notes: 
1. The front page will show you the current clinical trials including the profile of the Researcher(i.e. by default it is me). 
2. Once you contribute to the proposal, you automatically become one of the approvers.
3. Only the Manager/Researcher can request for funds. The Manager/Researcher has to ensure that the address is correct. He/She can use ones own address or that of the Third party recipient.
