One of the main problems in starting a Clinical Trial for is Funding.
I created this Decentralized application to help anyone who is interested in making a Clinical Trial possible using the Ethereum Blockchain and as part of my project in ConsenSys class.

Instructions

1. Create a Directory in your local drive
2. Clone the file in the directory you created in your local drive
3. Make sure you have the following dependencies (install if not):
fs-extra, ganache-cli, mocha, next, next-routes, react, react-dom, semantic-ui-css, semantic-ui-react,
solc, truffle-hdwallet-provider, web3

4. run the program using npm run dev

5. Open the browser at localhost:3000

6. Open your Metamask browser extension and your own account

7. Use the Rinkeby Test Network and make sure you have enough ether.
To be able to get ether you can go to https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ 
and follow the instructions. To request for funds, tweet with your Ethereum address pasted into the contents
via twitter, facebook and google plus public forum

8. You can now start creating a proposal for your own clinical trial 

Additional notes: 
1. The front page will show you the current clinical trials including the profile of the Researcher. 
2. Once you countribute to the proposal, you automatically become one of the approvers.
3. Only the Manager/Researcher can request for funds. The Manager/Researcher has to ensure that the address is correct. He/She can use ones own address or that of the Third party recipient.
